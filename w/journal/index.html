        </p>
        <p>
            the ash born is one of the more bestial demons. its form is said to be lithe and quick, with a feline head and limbs that dissolve into smoke at the extremities. its size is inconsistent between reports, but i conjecture it to be around the size of a large autocarriage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Xeovo is called ash-born, obscurer, lender. it has an affinity for lies, loopholes, and fluidity.
        </p>
        <p>
            there are those who claim that Xeovo was born along with the first forms of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            it was responsible for the fall of nevrä.
        </p>
        <p>
            occultists attested to have dealt with Xeovo are listed below in reverse chronological order. if the outcome or an event related to the dealings is known or conjectured, i have noted it. dealings seem to happen periodically, once every 300-500 years.

            the many-surfaced cannot physically be described in any confidence. it is an ever shifting fractal, each supposed outer shell or skin shrinking into itself as a layer beneath springs into being. it floats above the ground, approximately the size of a one meter radius sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Encolliate is called many surfaced, crusher, finder. it has an affinity for force, confusion, and the unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
            it is known to steal human children and turn them into monsters or heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
            legends report that Encolliate was created by occultists in the late suhan dynasty

            it of molten heart is the demon whose form we can be most confident in knowing. it has eight limbs, four of which are horse-like legs and four of which are human arms. its body is long, with little structure and great flexibility. its neck and face are human. instead of flesh, it is of superheated rock and earth, solid at the surface but not within.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vectra is called molten hearted, mover, distrupter. it has an affinity for velocity, sinuousness, and seismic activity.
